# R32D32 blockly

it's a(n) instance/fork/thing of [google's (now RaspberryPiFoundation's) blockly](https://github.com/RaspberriPiFoundation/blockly) specialised for Tinkertanker's ESP32 Droid kit.

## Serving
(copied from Google/RaspberryPiFoundation's default sample README.md)

To run your app locally, run `npm run start` to run the development server. This mode generates source maps and ingests the source maps created by Blockly, so that you can debug using unminified code.

To deploy your app so that others can use it, run `npm run build` to run a production build. This will bundle your code and minify it to reduce its size. You can then host the contents of the `dist` directory on a web server of your choosing. If you're just getting started, try using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
